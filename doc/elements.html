        <h1>Conceptpower Elements</h1>
        <p>Conceptpower knows three types of elements: entries referred to as "concepts," concept lists, and types. A concept is an entry in the authority list Conceptpower provides. A concept list groups together several concepts for organizational purposes. Types are categories concepts can be classified as. Each concept can be of one type at most. Every concept that is added to Conceptpower has to have type. Each concept that already exists in WordNet does not have a type. </p>
        
      	<h2>Concepts</h2>
      	<p>Each concept in Conceptpower has the following properties:</p>
      	<ul>
          	<li>Term:	Term that describes a concept (e.g. "house")</li>
	 		<li>URI: URI of an concept.</li>
			<li>Id:	Internal identifier for a concept.</li>
			<li>Wordnet id:	If an concept is contained in Wordnet, this is its id in Wordnet.</li>
			<li>POS:	Part of speech for a concept (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or other)</li>
			<li>Description:	Description of a concept.</li>
			<li>Concept list:	List of concepts that an concept belongs to (each concept can only be in one list).</li>
			<li>Type:	Type of a concept. Types can be defined as needed.</li>
			<li>Synonyms:	Synonyms for a concept.</li>
			<li>Equal to:	String that references another term that a concept is equal to (e.g. a link to the corresponding entry in viaf.org) </li>
			<li>Similar to:	String that references another term that a concept is similar to.</li>
			<li>Creator:	Creator of a concept.</li>
			<li>Modified:	Modification history of a concept.</li>
</li>
    	</ul>
    	
    	<p>There are three types of concepts: WordNet concepts, added concepts, and "(WordNet) concept wrapper." WordNet concepts are concepts that are contained in WordNet. If a concept has a WordNet id that equals its id then this concept is a WordNet concept. WordNet concepts don't have types. The fields "equals to," "similar to," "creator," or "modified" are empty as well. </p>
<p>Added concepts are concepts that were added to Conceptpower in addition to the concepts from WordNet. These concepts have to have a term describing it, a POS, concept list, description, and a type. </p>
<p>Concept wrappers wrap WordNet concepts so that additional information such as type or "equals to" can be attached to a WordNet concept. All the original information of a WordNet concept will be kept in a concept wrapper but can be extended.</p>
<p>Added concepts and concept wrapper cannot be fully deleted. They can be removed from concept lists and won't be found anymore when searching but they are still in the system. This way URIs of removed concepts stay valid.</p>

        <h2>Concept lists</h2>
<p>Concept lists are for organizational purposes only. Each concept or concept wrapper has to belong to a concept list. WordNet concepts are automatically in a concept list called "WordNet." Concept lists could for example group concepts into people, institutions, and places lists or sort concepts according to project focus. A concept belongs to exactly one concept list. </p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Every added concept and concept wrapper has to be of a certain type. WordNet concepts don't have types. Types should be created as needed. There are no default types when Conceptpower is newly installed. Because of the requirements of the project Conceptpower was originally developed for, each concept can be of maximal one type. The basic idea of Conceptpower is that relationships between concepts and between types are made outside of Conceptpower.</p>
